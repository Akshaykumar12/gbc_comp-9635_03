Week 1
======

Welcome to Mapping and Social Media Integration with JavaScript Web Services (COMP 9635).

:)

In this course we’re going to teach you to use APIs (application programming
interfaces) to access third-party services like Google Maps and Instagram.

The first step toward this will be learning how to use git. We’re going to use
git to manage our code, as a group. What you’re looking at now is actually a
git repository, pretty cool, eh? We're also going to create a basic HTTP
server so we can host our projects locally.

**Deliverables for Week 1:**  

01. Install homebrew and node https://treehouse.github.io/installation-guides/mac/node-mac.html
02. Fork this repository to your own Github account.
03. Add a folder `lastname-firstname` in the `week-01` folder.
04. Install node and npm.
05. Copy `index.js` from my sample folder to your `lastname-firstname` folder.
06. Copy `package.json` from my sample folder to your `lastname-firstname` folder.
07. Run `npm install express --save`
08. Create directory called `src` within your `lastname-firstname` folder.
09. Create a `index.html` file in this folder, with a short biography.
10. Run `npm start` to view your project at <http://localhost:3000>.
11. Submit a pull-request back to the parent repository.
